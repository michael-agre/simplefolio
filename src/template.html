                    Michael is well versed in risk and business analytics. He was the Credit Risk Manager for a team of three analysts, who collectively oversaw the acquisition underwriting strategy for multiple products. This included a personal credit card and point-of-sale financing. He regularly performed complex analytics for Sprint senior vice presidents and was relied upon heavily to make hugely impactful strategy suggestions. He generated entire underwriting strategies from nothing for multiple products. <br><br>

                    He also wrote business requirements for an online credit card application, starting with a blank word document. Finally, he helped design a direct mail pre-approval process, including mapping process flows, negotiating prices with vendors, and signing contracts with external vendors.

                    Michael is just as comfortable in aligning low-level technical details as he is in high-level strategy meetings. He has acted as an intermediary between the business teams and IT teams for countless large-scale projects. Also, he is usually the business owner for new feature testing<br><br>

                    He is an expert-level user of SQL, Tableau, and Excel with intermediate knowledge of python and R. He was responsible for a 10,000+ line Java program which performed fully automated underwriting for both credit cards and point-of-sale financing. This included manually coding Java, managing the development lifecycle, testing changes, and giving final approval for production deployments.

                    <br><br>Finally, Michael is an amateur web developer (including this website and more to follow). While he is not pursuing this as a career, he believes it is a critical skill in 21st century business.
